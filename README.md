# Student Database Management System

## Project Name: 
Student Database Management System

## Description:
The Student Database Management System is a console-based application that allows users to manage student records. The program will utilize C language's structures to represent student information, and it will make extensive use of pointers for dynamic memory allocation.

## Features:
- Create a structure to represent a student, including fields like name, roll number, age, and grades.
- Implement functions to add new students to the database.
- Develop a function to display the details of all students in the database.
- Include a search function that allows users to find a student's information by their roll number or name.
- Implement a function to update a student's information, such as grades or age.
- Add functionality to delete a student's record from the database.
- Save the student records to a file so that they can be loaded later when the program runs again.

## Skills Demonstrated:
- Understanding of C language structures to organize and represent data.
- Proficiency in using pointers for dynamic memory allocation and manipulation.
- Handling file I/O operations to save and load data.
- Implementing functions for data manipulation, search, and update.
- Basic error handling to deal with edge cases, like invalid input or empty records.
